          <ul>
              <li>Areas: Electoral vote and US Map</li>
              <li>Lines</li> 
            </ul>
            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <ul> 
                  <li>Color represents the party majority in each state. Blue represents Clinton, red represents Trump, and both means that there is no clear majority.  </li>
                  <li>This is a good mapping because the two different colors are easily distinguishable from eachother. The viewer can tell which political party is dominanting in a given state.</li>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2 >ColorMap(s)</h2>
            <ul> 
              <li>Categorical</li>
              <ul> 
                <li>Using blue and red, each color represents each of votes would have gone to</li>
                <li>This a great choice because not only is it easily distinguishable but each color is representative of the poltical party.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

          <h2>Marks</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>points: represents a datapoint</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Position</li>
            <ul> 
              <li> the x-axis represents the velocity and the y-axis represents the launch angle of the ball.   </li>
              <li> This is a good choice because you are able to see the correlation of both exit velocity and lauch angle,where most of these points lie, and you can clearly tell what each balls . </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <ul> 
              <li> The brighter orange huge represnts a higher scoring hit, while a darker purple hue represenets a average-to-low scoring hit </li>
              <li> While it allows the viewer to make assumptions about where the "ideal" spot for a hit would be. 
                These colors can be lost in the gradient in the graphic, espcially in contrast to the white gradient. The colorscheme is also not the easiest to see and not might be acceessible for all   </li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>ColorMap(s)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Diverging: represeents the scoring of balls hit </li>
            <ul> 
              <li> As mentioned prior, this is a good colormap choice because the viewer can easily distinguish low scoring hits from high scoring hits. 
                The viewer can also tell that the majority of the hits are in the middle of the graph, which is what you would expect.

            <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Area: The area under the curve represents the accumulated sum of the scores over the years.</li>
            <li>Line: represents the trend of score of netflix movies over time</li>

              <li>Color(hue)</li>
              <ul> 
                <li> The line representing the trend of score of Netflix movies is plotted in red. (continuous / ordinal attribute)  </li>
                
                <li> Effective use as it helps to emphasize the data and convey additional information about the score of Netflix movies over the years</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Position on a common scale (both horizontal and vertical)</li>
              <ul> 
                <li> represents the cumulative audience scores vs. release year for movies on netflix (ordered ordinal)
                  </li>
                <li> This is a good mapping because there it is able to show the individual cumulative audience scores at a certain year</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>ColorMap(s)</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Divergent</li>
              <ul> 
                <li> blue is used as the area under the curve, while the red used in the line is used to highlight the trend  </li>
                <li> This is a good mapping because it is used to represent a different channel. The colors are easy to differentiate, and they are roughly the same saturation</li>
